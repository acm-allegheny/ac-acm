### **What We're Building**
A basic personal chatbot that you can run on your computer, talk to, and customize.

### **Getting Set Up**

Installing the required tools:

- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- Ollama

### **Downloading the Model**
Using Ollama to download and run the Deepseek model.

### **Using the Chatbot**
How to talk to your chatbot through the terminal or a simple interface.

### **Basic Customization**
Editing a few lines to change how the chatbot responds or what kind of personality it has.

## **Requirements for Participants**

- Visual Studio Code installed
- Python 3.12.8
- No coding or technical experience needed

## **Expected Outcomes**

By the end of the session, participants will:

- Have a working AI chatbot running on their own computer
